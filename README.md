## Description
Fridge Friend is an application that allows users to create an account and manage their refrigerator. They can add items to their fridge with information about each item, such as, the item name, quantity, category and expiration date. The users fridge inventory will display the items in ascending order by expiration date. This way users will always know which items are expiring soon. The expiration date is color coded to help the user identify expired or expiring items right away and cut down on unnecessary food waste. In addition to the color coded dates, users will receive email notifications telling them that items are expiring soon and expired. Users also have the ability to filter their dashboard view by food category, as well as, update an item's quantity and delete items they have used or that have expired.
